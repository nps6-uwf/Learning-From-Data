## Exercise 1.12)

A friend comes to you with a learning problem. She says the target function is completely unknown, but she has 4, 000 data points. She is 
willing to pay you to solve her problem and produce for her a <i>g</i> which 
approximates <i>f</i>. What is the best that you can promise her among the 
following: 

<ol>
  <li>After learning you will provide her with a g that you will guarantee 
a pproximates well out of sample. </li>  
  <li>After learning you will provide her with a g, and with high probability 
the g which you produce will a pproximate well out of sample. </li>
  <li>
    One of two things will happen: 
    
    (i) You will produce a hypothesis g; 
    (ii) You will declare that you failed. 
    If you do return a hypothesis g, then with high probability  the g which 
    you produce will approximate well out of sample.   
  </li>
</ol>
